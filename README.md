# Subscription_Service_Analysis_Forecast_Project
This is my final data science project in Datalab institue. 
This project involves cleaning and processing of data from a book subscription platform -livebook (the given actions2load dataset), and preparing it for investigatory analysis to discover customer use patterns. Raw data of customer behaviour was loaded into an SQL database for analysis, the events record were categorized and checked for bad data, insights were generated that helped to understand various metrics and forecast next events possible.
